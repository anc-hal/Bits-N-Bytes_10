## Hospital Management System

Welcome to the Hospital Management System repository, developed by Anchal Chauhan.

## Introduction

The Hospital Management System is designed to streamline and optimize hospital management processes. With an integrated AI-powered chatbot, this system aims to provide comprehensive support for managing patient records, appointments, medical staff, inventory, billing, and patient interaction.

The AI chatbot serves as a virtual guide, assisting patients with inquiries, providing information about services, and offering support throughout their healthcare journey. Our goal is to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and patient care within healthcare facilities, providing a seamless experience for both medical staff and patients.
